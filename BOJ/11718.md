## Basic

Write a program that outputs what it receives as input.

## Points

### fgets

"scanf" translate space(' '), tab('\t') and enter('\n') as a seperator. But "fgets" translate only enter as a seperator.

So in this problem where we need to seperate each input only by enter input('\n'), it's better use "fgets" instead of "scanf"
